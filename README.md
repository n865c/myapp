Hello and welcome to the ReadMe for the frontend of Movihub React!

Movihub React is a web application that allows users to search for movies and view details about them. This frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have these installed, you can follow these steps to run the application:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Run the command npm install to install all of the project's dependencies.

Run the command ``npm start`` to start the development server.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the application.

Once the application is running, you will be presented with a search bar where you can search for movies by title. When you submit your search, the application will display a list of movies that match your query. You can then click on a movie to view more details about it, such as its rating, release date, and a brief overview.

This application uses the Movie Database API to fetch movie data. In order to use this API, you will need to obtain an API key from the Movie Database website and add it to the ``.env`` file in the root directory of the project.
